# Test Driven Development (TDD) with C# and xUnit

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a powerful approach to build solid and robust software. Unit Testing is a type of software testing where code is written to automate the testing of sub-sections of an entire application. This methodology gives more functional coverage and reduces the need for manual regression testing when the application's code changes. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.
